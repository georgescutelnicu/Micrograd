#### Micrograd
Micrograd does all the calculations behind the training of a neural network. <br>

This project was made following Andrej Karpathy's video "The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd".
Variable values and names are changed and there are also other small changes in the structure of the project compared to the original one.
